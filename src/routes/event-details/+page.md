## Dress Code
Black tie optional; dancing shoes preferred!
 
## Adults Only, Please
While we love your kiddos, this celebration is for for our adult friends only. If you need recommendations for childcare in the area, please let us know.
 
## Arrival Time
Please try to arrive at the venue no later than 5:45 p.m. so that everyone has time to get seated before the ceremony begins.
 
## Dietary Restrictions
We eat a diet Aimee likes to refer to as “pollo-pescatarian” (i.e., poultry and seafood). Therefore, we will be serving items that fit within that description. If you have any further dietary restrictions, please let us know.
 
## Photos
We ask that you kindly refrain from taking photos during our ceremony, but you are more than welcome to take photos during our reception! If you get anything good (i.e., pictures of Kevin and Aimee looking fabulous, or equally important, photos we can use to blackmail our friends and family later), please share them with us after!
 
## Please, No Gifts!
Your presence and well wishes are the best gifts for which we could ask!
